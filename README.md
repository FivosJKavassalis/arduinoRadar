# arduinoRadar

In HackCooper 2018, we built a Radar which consists of a servo motor that periodically does a half circle (stops when requested through an external button) which has an ultrasonic sensor placed on top of it. The radii of the radar become red or green, depending on whether the sensor spots an object or not in a specific angle and distance.
